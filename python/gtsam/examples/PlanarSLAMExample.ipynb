    "This notebook demonstrates a basic Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) problem in 2D using GTSAM.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is GTSAM?**\n",
    "GTSAM (Georgia Tech Smoothing and Mapping) is a library that implements factor graph-based optimization. It's widely used in robotics for problems like SLAM, Structure from Motion (SfM), and sensor fusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is a Factor Graph?**\n",
    "A factor graph is a graphical model that represents the probabilistic relationships between unknown variables (like robot poses and landmark positions) and measurements (like odometry or sensor readings). Optimization in GTSAM involves finding the most likely configuration of variables given the measurements and their associated uncertainties (noise).\n",
    "\n",
    "**This Example:**\n",
    "We'll simulate a robot moving in a 2D plane. The robot has:\n",
    "1.  **Odometry:** Measurements of its own motion (how far it moved between steps).\n",
    "2.  **Bearing-Range Sensor:** A sensor (like a simple laser scanner) that measures the bearing (angle) and range (distance) to landmarks.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll build a factor graph representing the robot's poses, landmark positions, odometry measurements, and bearing-range measurements. Then, we'll use GTSAM to optimize the graph and find the best estimate of the robot's trajectory and landmark locations."

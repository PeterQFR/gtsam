    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The `WhiteNoiseFactor` class in GTSAM is a specialized factor used in nonlinear optimization problems, particularly in the context of probabilistic graphical models. This class models the effect of white noise on a measurement, which is a common assumption in many estimation problems. The primary purpose of this class is to incorporate the uncertainty due to white noise into the optimization process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Functionalities\n",
    "\n",
    "### Noise Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "- **White Noise Assumption**: The class assumes that the noise affecting the measurements is Gaussian and uncorrelated, which is often referred to as \"white noise\". This assumption simplifies the mathematical treatment of noise in the optimization problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Factor Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Error Calculation**: The `WhiteNoiseFactor` computes the error between the predicted and observed measurements, incorporating the noise model. This error is crucial for the optimization process as it influences the adjustment of variables to minimize the overall error in the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Jacobian Computation**: The class provides methods to compute the Jacobian of the error function with respect to the variables involved. The Jacobian is essential for gradient-based optimization techniques, as it provides the necessary derivatives to guide the optimization algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "The error function for a `WhiteNoiseFactor` can be represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ e(x) = h(x) - z $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $e(x)$ is the error function.\n",
    "- $h(x)$ is the predicted measurement based on the current estimate of the variables.\n",
    "- $z$ is the observed measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The noise is assumed to be Gaussian with zero mean and a certain covariance, which is often represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{Cov}(e) = \\sigma^2 I $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\sigma^2$ is the variance of the noise and $I$ is the identity matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimization Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Factor Graphs**: The `WhiteNoiseFactor` is integrated into factor graphs, which are a key structure in GTSAM for representing and solving large-scale estimation problems. Each factor in the graph contributes to the overall error that the optimization process seeks to minimize.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Nonlinear Optimization**: The class is designed to work seamlessly with GTSAM's nonlinear optimization framework, allowing it to handle complex, real-world estimation problems that involve non-linear relationships between variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Assumptions**: Users should ensure that the white noise assumption is valid for their specific application, as deviations from this assumption can lead to suboptimal estimation results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Integration**: The `WhiteNoiseFactor` should be used in conjunction with other factors and variables in a factor graph to effectively model the entire system being estimated.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Performance**: The efficiency of the optimization process can be influenced by the choice of noise model and the structure of the factor graph. Proper tuning and validation are recommended to achieve optimal performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the `WhiteNoiseFactor` class is a powerful tool in GTSAM for modeling and mitigating the effects of white noise in nonlinear estimation problems. Its integration into factor graphs and compatibility with GTSAM's optimization algorithms make it a versatile component for a wide range of applications."

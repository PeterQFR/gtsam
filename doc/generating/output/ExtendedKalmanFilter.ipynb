    "# ExtendedKalmanFilter Class Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "*Disclaimer: This documentation was generated by AI and may require human revision for accuracy and completeness.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ExtendedKalmanFilter` class in GTSAM is a robust implementation of the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), which is a powerful tool for estimating the state of a nonlinear dynamic system. The EKF extends the capabilities of the traditional Kalman Filter by linearizing about the current mean and covariance, making it suitable for nonlinear systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Nonlinear State Estimation**: The EKF is designed to handle systems where the state transition and observation models are nonlinear.\n",
    "- **Predict and Update Cycles**: The class provides mechanisms to predict the future state and update the current state estimate based on new measurements.\n",
    "- **Covariance Management**: It maintains and updates the state covariance matrix, which represents the uncertainty of the state estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mathematical Foundation\n",
    "\n",
    "The EKF operates on the principle of linearizing nonlinear functions around the current estimate. The primary equations involved in the EKF are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **State Prediction**:\n",
    "   $$ \\hat{x}_{k|k-1} = f(\\hat{x}_{k-1|k-1}, u_k) $$\n",
    "   $$ P_{k|k-1} = F_k P_{k-1|k-1} F_k^T + Q_k $$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Measurement Update**:\n",
    "   $$ y_k = z_k - h(\\hat{x}_{k|k-1}) $$\n",
    "   $$ S_k = H_k P_{k|k-1} H_k^T + R_k $$\n",
    "   $$ K_k = P_{k|k-1} H_k^T S_k^{-1} $$\n",
    "   $$ \\hat{x}_{k|k} = \\hat{x}_{k|k-1} + K_k y_k $$\n",
    "   $$ P_{k|k} = (I - K_k H_k) P_{k|k-1} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $f$ and $h$ are the nonlinear state transition and measurement functions, respectively.\n",
    "- $F_k$ and $H_k$ are the Jacobians of $f$ and $h$.\n",
    "- $Q_k$ and $R_k$ are the process and measurement noise covariance matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Constructor**: Initializes the filter with a given initial state and covariance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "- **predict**: Advances the state estimate to the next time step using the state transition model. It computes the predicted state and updates the state covariance matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Update\n",
    "\n",
    "- **update**: Incorporates a new measurement into the state estimate. It calculates the innovation, updates the state estimate, and adjusts the covariance matrix accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accessors\n",
    "\n",
    "- **getState**: Returns the current estimated state.\n",
    "- **getCovariance**: Provides the current state covariance matrix, representing the uncertainty of the estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ExtendedKalmanFilter` class is typically used in a loop where the `predict` method is called to project the state forward in time, and the `update` method is called whenever a new measurement is available. This cycle continues, refining the state estimate and reducing uncertainty over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ExtendedKalmanFilter` class in GTSAM is a versatile tool for state estimation in nonlinear systems. By leveraging the power of linearization, it provides accurate and efficient estimation capabilities, making it suitable for a wide range of applications in robotics, navigation, and control systems."

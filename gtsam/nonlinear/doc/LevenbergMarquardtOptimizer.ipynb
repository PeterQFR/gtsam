    "# LevenbergMarquardtOptimizer Class Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "*Disclaimer: This documentation was generated by AI and may require human revision for accuracy and completeness.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The `LevenbergMarquardtOptimizer` class in GTSAM is a specialized optimizer that implements the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. This algorithm is a popular choice for solving non-linear least squares problems, which are common in various applications such as computer vision, robotics, and machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is an iterative technique that interpolates between the Gauss-Newton algorithm and the method of gradient descent. It is particularly useful for optimizing problems where the solution is expected to be near the initial guess.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Non-linear Optimization**: The class is designed to handle non-linear optimization problems efficiently.\n",
    "- **Damping Mechanism**: It incorporates a damping parameter to control the step size, balancing between the Gauss-Newton and gradient descent methods.\n",
    "- **Iterative Improvement**: The optimizer iteratively refines the solution, reducing the error at each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mathematical Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm seeks to minimize a cost function $F(x)$ of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F(x) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} r_i(x)^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $r_i(x)$ are the residuals. The update rule for the algorithm is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x_{k+1} = x_k - (J^T J + \\lambda I)^{-1} J^T r\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $J$ is the Jacobian matrix of the residuals, $\\lambda$ is the damping parameter, and $I$ is the identity matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Constructor**: Initializes the optimizer with the given parameters and initial values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "- **optimize**: Executes the optimization process, iteratively updating the solution to minimize the cost function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameter Control\n",
    "\n",
    "- **setLambda**: Sets the damping parameter $\\lambda$, which influences the convergence behavior.\n",
    "- **getLambda**: Retrieves the current value of the damping parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Convergence and Termination\n",
    "\n",
    "- **checkConvergence**: Evaluates whether the optimization process has converged based on predefined criteria.\n",
    "- **terminate**: Stops the optimization process when certain conditions are met.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- The choice of the initial guess can significantly affect the convergence speed and the quality of the solution.\n",
    "- Proper tuning of the damping parameter $\\lambda$ is crucial for balancing the convergence rate and stability.\n",
    "- The optimizer is most effective when the residuals are approximately linear near the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "This class is a powerful tool for tackling complex optimization problems where traditional linear methods fall short. By leveraging the strengths of both Gauss-Newton and gradient descent, the `LevenbergMarquardtOptimizer` provides a robust framework for achieving accurate solutions in non-linear least squares problems."

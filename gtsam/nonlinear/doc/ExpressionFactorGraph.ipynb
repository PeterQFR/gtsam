    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ExpressionFactorGraph` class in GTSAM is a specialized factor graph designed to work with expressions. It extends the capabilities of a standard factor graph by allowing the incorporation of symbolic expressions, which can be particularly useful in applications requiring symbolic computation and automatic differentiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Expression Handling**: The class allows for the creation and manipulation of factors that are expressed symbolically. This can be advantageous in scenarios where the relationships between variables are best described using mathematical expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Automatic Differentiation**: By leveraging expressions, the class supports automatic differentiation, which is crucial for optimizing complex systems where derivatives are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Integration with GTSAM**: As part of the GTSAM library, `ExpressionFactorGraph` seamlessly integrates with other components, allowing for robust and efficient factor graph optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Main Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding Factors\n",
    "\n",
    "- **addExpressionFactor**: This method allows the user to add a new factor to the graph based on a symbolic expression. The expression defines the relationship between the variables involved in the factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Graph Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **update**: This method updates the factor graph with new information. It recalculates the necessary components to ensure that the graph remains consistent with the added expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **linearize**: Converts the expression-based factor graph into a linear factor graph. This is a crucial step for optimization, as many algorithms operate on linear approximations of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "- **optimize**: This method runs the optimization process on the factor graph. It uses the symbolic expressions to guide the optimization, ensuring that the solution respects the relationships defined by the expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mathematical Foundations\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ExpressionFactorGraph` leverages several mathematical concepts to perform its functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Factor Graphs**: A factor graph is a bipartite graph representing the factorization of a function. In the context of GTSAM, it is used to represent the joint probability distribution of a set of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Expressions**: Symbolic expressions are used to define the relationships between variables. These expressions can be differentiated and manipulated symbolically, providing flexibility and power in modeling complex systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Automatic Differentiation**: This technique is used to compute derivatives of functions defined by expressions. It is essential for optimization algorithms that require gradient information.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ExpressionFactorGraph` class is a powerful tool within the GTSAM library, offering advanced capabilities for working with symbolic expressions in factor graphs. Its integration of automatic differentiation and symbolic computation makes it particularly useful for complex optimization problems where traditional numerical methods may fall short. Users familiar with factor graphs and symbolic mathematics will find this class to be a valuable addition to their toolkit."

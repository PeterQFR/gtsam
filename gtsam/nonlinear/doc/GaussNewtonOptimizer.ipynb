    "# GaussNewtonOptimizer Class Documentation\n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The `GaussNewtonOptimizer` class in GTSAM is designed to optimize nonlinear factor graphs using the Gauss-Newton algorithm. This class is particularly suited for problems where the cost function can be approximated well by a quadratic function near the minimum. The Gauss-Newton method is an iterative optimization technique that updates the solution by linearizing the nonlinear system at each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Iterative Optimization**: The optimizer refines the solution iteratively by linearizing the nonlinear system around the current estimate.\n",
    "- **Convergence Control**: It provides mechanisms to control the convergence through parameters such as maximum iterations and relative error tolerance.\n",
    "- **Integration with GTSAM**: Seamlessly integrates with GTSAM's factor graph framework, allowing it to be used with various types of factors and variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constructor\n",
    "\n",
    "- **GaussNewtonOptimizer**: Initializes the optimizer with a given factor graph and initial values. The constructor sets up the optimization problem and prepares it for iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "- **optimize**: Executes the optimization process. This method runs the Gauss-Newton iterations until convergence criteria are met, such as reaching the maximum number of iterations or achieving a relative error below a specified threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Convergence Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "- **checkConvergence**: Evaluates whether the optimization process has converged based on the change in error and the specified tolerance levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accessors\n",
    "\n",
    "- **error**: Returns the current error of the factor graph with respect to the current estimate. This is useful for monitoring the progress of the optimization.\n",
    "- **values**: Retrieves the current estimate of the variable values after optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mathematical Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gauss-Newton algorithm is based on the idea of linearizing the nonlinear residuals $r(x)$ around the current estimate $x_k$. The update step is derived from solving the normal equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ J(x_k)^T J(x_k) \\Delta x = -J(x_k)^T r(x_k) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $J(x_k)$ is the Jacobian of the residuals with respect to the variables. The solution $\\Delta x$ is used to update the estimate:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x_{k+1} = x_k + \\Delta x $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is repeated iteratively until convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initial Guess**: The quality of the initial guess can significantly affect the convergence and performance of the Gauss-Newton optimizer.\n",
    "- **Non-convexity**: Since the method relies on linear approximations, it may struggle with highly non-convex problems or those with poor initial estimates.\n",
    "- **Performance**: The Gauss-Newton method is generally faster than other nonlinear optimization methods like Levenberg-Marquardt for problems that are well-approximated by a quadratic model near the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the `GaussNewtonOptimizer` is a powerful tool for solving nonlinear optimization problems in factor graphs, particularly when the problem is well-suited to quadratic approximation. Its integration with GTSAM makes it a versatile choice for various applications in robotics and computer vision."

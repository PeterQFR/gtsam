    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The `AHRSFactor` class implements a factor to implement an *Attitude and Heading Reference System* (AHRS) within GTSAM. It is a binary factor, taking preintegrated measurements from a gyroscope between two discrete time steps, typically denoted as $t_i$ and $t_j$. These preintegrated measurements encapsulate the rotational motion observed by an inertial measurement unit (IMU) between these two timestamps.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `AHRSFactor` thus constrains two attitude states (represented as elements of $SO(3)$) based solely on gyroscope measurements. Accelerometer or magnetometer aiding, needed to build a complete AHRS system, must be handled separately."

    "## Mathematical Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "The `AHRSFactor` relies on the use of `PreintegratedRotation`, which applies successive exponential maps to each individual gyroscope measurement $\\omega$ over the interval $[t_i, t_j]$. In this approach, every measurement contributes a small rotation given by $\\exp(\\omega_k \\Delta t)$, and the overall preintegrated rotation is obtained by composing these incremental rotations:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Delta R_{ij}^{meas} = \\prod_{k} \\exp(\\omega_k \\Delta t)\n",
    "$$\n",

    "Given two estimated rotations $R_i$ at time $t_i$ and $R_j$ at time $t_j$, the factor enforces:\n",

    "R_j \\approx R_i \\cdot \\Delta R_{ij}^{meas}\n",

    "Note: the reality is a bit more complicated, because the code also takes into account the effects of bias, and if desired, coriolis forces."

    "- `evaluateError`: calculates the error between two estimated orientations at times $t_i$ and $t_j$, relative to the preintegrated gyroscopic measurements. The error is computed as:\n",

    "  Here:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - $R_i, R_j$ are the estimated rotation matrices at times $t_i$ and $t_j$.\n",
    "  - $\\Delta R_{ij}^{meas}$ is the rotation matrix obtained by integrating gyroscope measurements from $t_i$ to $t_j$.\n",
    "  - $\\text{Log}(\\cdot)$ is the logarithmic map from $SO(3)$ to $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "  The resulting 3-dimensional error vector represents the rotational discrepancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `print`: outputs a readable representation of the internal state of the factor, including the associated time steps and preintegrated measurements, aiding debugging and verification.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `equals` determines if another `AHRSFactor` instance is identical, useful in testing scenarios or when verifying the correctness of factor graph constructions."
